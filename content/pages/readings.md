The readings on this page constitute a general overview and introduction to the course topics.

Each sub-task group begins their investigation with a literature search. By the end of the semester, students will have read and discussed a large number of other sources. The {{% resource_link 72ee7639-0e17-ec22-2b1a-a6d5bb9c5925 "final project report" "#Final" %}} lists these additional readings in the References section.

## Core

A report prepared for the {{% resource_link "73fc9f2a-7160-4f01-8c4a-3b0c828ed6eb" "Generation IV International Forum Technology Roadmap" %}} on new reactor concepts and their R&D status.

_Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap_. U.S. Department of Energy. April 2010. ({{% resource_link 6a2afa14-552d-7d18-ad15-a726bbd3334f "PDF - 3.7MB" %}})   
This is a good summary of some of the issues to keep in mind when deciding on your choice of reactor technology.

## Process Heat

A good summary and references about well-established heat storage methods with a large number of compound properties.

## Hydrogen

Yildiz, B., and M. S. Kazimi. "{{% resource_link "9a27c0cf-581e-4208-bf5c-29f8674f7cca" "Efficiency of Hydrogen Production Systems Using Alternative Nuclear Energy Technologies" %}}." _International Journal of Hydrogen Energy_ 31, no. 1 (2006): 77–92.   
A summary of some major technologies for hydrogen production, and ways that nuclear power is suited to drive them.

## Biofuels

Lynd, L. R., et al. "{{% resource_link "8940109a-1eb2-4ecd-8dcd-3d5b528f0a92" "The Role of Biomass in America's Energy Future: Framing the Analysis" %}}." _Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining_ 3, no. 2 (2009): 113–23.   
An excellent summary of how the leaders in biofuel plant design forsee it playing a role in our future. TONS of good references in here; also check the journal for more papers in this series.
